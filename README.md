"#Quayzy - medical questionaire app"
Consists out of two parts: android app and REST API on the web to retrieve and get the questions. <br/>
REST API is available at http://coderhymes.com/loginforquayzy/insertion.php <br/>
App written in Kotlin and Java, backend written in plain php. <br/>
Plain php because I wanted to know how APIs work in depth. <br/>
In the process, I received the knowledge that writting code in plain php is a sin and everyone who does that has either no soul or is a masochist. Of course this is being said in a good spirit but seriously. Don't do that.
